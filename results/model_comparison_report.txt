MODEL COMPARISON ANALYSIS REPORT
=================================

PROJECT OVERVIEW
----------------
- Project: Customer Review Pattern Analysis and Buying Decision Prediction
- Objective: Compare XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost models for purchase prediction
- Dataset: Customer Review Data with 100 samples (augmented to ~112 with SMOTE)
- Target: Predict "Purchased" (Yes/No) based on customer attributes

DATASET INFORMATION
-------------------
- Original Dataset Shape: (100, 6)
- Columns: Age, Gender, Review, Education, Purchased
- Target Distribution (original): No: 56 samples (56%), Yes: 44 samples (44%)
- Preprocessing: Categorical encoding, age groups, feature combinations, SMOTE augmentation

FEATURE ENGINEERING
-------------------
- Created age groups: Young (18-25), Adult (26-35), Middle (36-50), Senior (51-60)
- Created feature combinations: Gender_Review, Review_Edu
- Applied StandardScaler to numerical features
- Used SMOTE to balance the dataset
