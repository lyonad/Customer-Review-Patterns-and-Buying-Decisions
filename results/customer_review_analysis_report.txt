PROJECT OVERVIEW
----------------
- Project: Customer Review Pattern Analysis and Buying Decision Prediction
- Objective: Compare XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost models with Grey Wolf Optimization
- Dataset: Customer Review Data with 100 samples

- Requirement: Achieve >80% accuracy with short training time

DATASET INFORMATION
-------------------
- Original Dataset Shape: (100, 6)
- Columns: Serial Number, Age, Gender, Review, Education, Purchased
- Target Distribution: 
  - No: 56 samples (56%)
  - Yes: 44 samples (44%)
- Features: Age (18-59), Gender (Male/Female), Review (Poor/Average/Good), Education (School/UG/PG)

FEATURE ENGINEERING
-------------------
- Created age groups: Young (18-25), Adult (26-35), Middle (36-50), Senior (51-60)
- Created feature combinations: Gender_Review, Review_Edu
- Applied StandardScaler to numerical features
- Used SMOTE to balance the dataset from 100 to 112 samples

OPTIMIZATION METHOD
-------------------
- Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO) algorithm for hyperparameter tuning
- Iterations: 100 for each model
